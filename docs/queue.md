# üì¶ Queue System Documentation

I am making a complete doc guide for the queue system so that when we are writing code we dont do so much back and forth, and we can just copy content from here.
I am making this a bit less technical so that our non-tech documentation team can also understand it.

## Overview

The Daraja Toolkit uses a robust queue system built with **BullMQ** and **Redis** to handle M-Pesa webhook deliveries asynchronously.

## üéØ What is the Queue System?

Think of the queue system like a **smart post office**:

1. **M-Pesa sends a webhook** (like mailing a letter)
2. **Webhook Service receives it** (post office receives the letter)
3. **Job added to queue** (letter sorted and stored safely)
4. **Delivery Worker picks up job** (mail carrier collects letter)
5. **Webhook delivered to user's app** (letter delivered to recipient)

If delivery fails, the system automatically retries with smart delays.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
M-Pesa Webhooks ‚Üí Webhook Service ‚Üí Redis Queue ‚Üí Delivery Worker ‚Üí User's App
                      ‚Üì              ‚Üì            ‚Üì
                   (Producer)    (Storage)    (Consumer)
```

### Components

- **Webhook Service**: Receives webhooks and adds them to the queue
- **Redis**: Stores jobs reliably and manages queue state
- **Delivery Worker**: Processes jobs from the queue and delivers webhooks
- **BullMQ**: Queue management library handling priorities, retries, and monitoring

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Asynchronous Processing**

- Webhooks are queued instantly (no blocking)
- Background workers process jobs continuously
- High throughput - handles thousands of webhooks per minute

### ‚úÖ **Priority Handling**

- **URGENT** (Priority 20): Critical payment failures
- **HIGH** (Priority 10): Important transactions
- **NORMAL** (Priority 5): Standard payments (default)
- **LOW** (Priority 1): Non-critical notifications

### ‚úÖ **Automatic Retries**

- **3 attempts** for failed deliveries (configurable per user)
- **Exponential backoff**: 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s delays (intelligent per error type)
- **Dead letter queue** for permanently failed jobs
- **Error categorization**: Network, timeout, 4xx, 5xx, rate limit, authentication
- **Smart retry logic**: Different strategies per error type
- **Manual retry**: Retry failed jobs from DLQ via API

### ‚úÖ **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**

- **Separate queue** for jobs that failed all retry attempts
- **Failure analysis**: Track error patterns and categories
- **Manual management**: View, retry, and clear failed jobs
- **DLQ health monitoring**: Alerts when DLQ size grows
- **Bulk operations**: Retry multiple jobs at once

### ‚úÖ **Fault Tolerance**

- Jobs survive service restarts (Redis persistence)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Connection resilience and error recovery

### ‚úÖ **Monitoring & Health Checks**

- Real-time queue metrics
- Health check endpoints
- Comprehensive logging

## üìã Queue Configuration

### Priority Levels

```javascript
PRIORITY_LEVELS = {
  LOW: 1, // Non-critical notifications
  NORMAL: 5, // Standard payments (default)
  HIGH: 10, // Important transactions
  URGENT: 20, // Critical payment failures
};
```

### Job Options

```javascript
DEFAULT_JOB_OPTIONS = {
  removeOnComplete: 100, // Keep 100 completed jobs for monitoring
  removeOnFail: 50, // Keep 50 failed jobs for debugging
  attempts: 3, // Retry up to 3 times
  backoff: {
    type: "exponential", // Smart delay between retries
    delay: 2000, // Start with 2 second delay
  },
};
```

### Redis Configuration

- **Host**: localhost (configurable via environment)
- **Port**: 6379 (configurable via environment)
- **Database**: 0 (dedicated for queue)
- **Persistence**: Enabled for job durability

## üîÑ How Jobs Flow Through the System

### 1. **Job Creation** (Webhook Service)

```
POST /webhook/user123
‚Üì
Webhook received and validated
‚Üì
Job added to Redis queue with priority
‚Üì
Response sent to M-Pesa (instant)
```

### 2. **Job Processing** (Delivery Worker)

```
Worker picks up job from queue
‚Üì
Look up user's webhook URL
‚Üì
Attempt delivery to user's app
‚Üì
Success: Job marked complete
‚Üì
Failure: Schedule retry with delay
```

### 3. **Retry Logic**

```
Attempt 1: Immediate delivery
‚Üì (if failed)
Wait 2 seconds ‚Üí Attempt 2
‚Üì (if failed)
Wait 4 seconds ‚Üí Attempt 3
‚Üì (if failed)
Job moved to failed state (dead letter queue)
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints

#### Basic Health Check

```bash
GET /health
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "webhook-service",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-24T07:32:54.655Z"
}
```

#### Queue Health Check

```bash
GET /health/queue
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "service": "webhook-service",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-24T07:33:04.181Z",
  "status": "healthy",
  "queue": {
    "name": "webhook-delivery",
    "waiting": 0, // Jobs waiting to be processed
    "active": 2, // Jobs currently being processed
    "failed": 1, // Jobs that failed permanently
    "completed": 847 // Jobs completed successfully
  },
  "redis": {
    "connected": true // Redis connection status
  }
}
```

### Queue Metrics

- **Waiting**: Jobs in queue waiting for processing
- **Active**: Jobs currently being processed by workers
- **Failed**: Jobs that failed after all retry attempts
- **Completed**: Successfully processed jobs

## üß™ Testing the Queue System

### Send Test Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/webhook/test_user \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "Body": {
      "stkCallback": {
        "MerchantRequestID": "test-123",
        "CheckoutRequestID": "test-456",
        "ResultCode": 0,
        "ResultDesc": "Success"
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Test Priority Handling

```bash
# Low priority webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/test/priority/user123/low

# High priority webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/test/priority/user123/high

# Urgent priority webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/test/priority/user123/urgent
```

### Check Queue Status

```bash
# Basic health
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Detailed queue health
curl http://localhost:3001/health/queue
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST="localhost"
REDIS_PORT="6379"
REDIS_PASSWORD=""
REDIS_DB="0"

# Service Configuration
WEBHOOK_SERVICE_PORT="3001"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

## üö® Error Handling

### Common Scenarios

#### **Webhook URL Unreachable**

```
üöÄ Delivering webhook to http://user-app.com/webhook
‚ùå Delivery failed: Unable to connect
‚è≥ Retrying in 2000ms (attempt 2/3)
```

**Action**: System automatically retries with exponential backoff

#### **User App Returns Error**

```
üöÄ Delivering webhook to http://user-app.com/webhook
‚ùå Delivery failed: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
‚è≥ Retrying in 4000ms (attempt 3/3)
```

**Action**: System retries, then moves to failed state if all attempts fail

#### **Redis Connection Lost**

```
‚ùå Redis connection lost
üîÑ Attempting to reconnect...
‚úÖ Redis connection restored
```

**Action**: Jobs are persisted, system reconnects automatically

### Dead Letter Queue

Failed jobs are moved to a "failed" state where they can be:

- Inspected for debugging
- Manually retried if needed
- Analyzed for patterns

## üîê Security Considerations

### Network Security

- Redis accessible only from internal network
- No external Redis access
- TLS encryption available for production

### Data Security

- Webhook payloads stored temporarily in Redis
- Automatic cleanup of old jobs
- No sensitive data logged

### Access Control

- Queue operations require service authentication
- Health endpoints publicly accessible
- Admin operations protected

## üöÄ Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Multiple Workers**: Add more delivery worker instances
- **Load Balancing**: Workers automatically distribute jobs
- **Redis Cluster**: Scale Redis for higher throughput

### Vertical Scaling

- **Worker Concurrency**: Increase concurrent jobs per worker
- **Redis Memory**: Increase for more job storage
- **CPU/RAM**: Scale for higher processing power

### Monitoring at Scale

- **Metrics Collection**: Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for queue depth, failures
- **Dashboards**: Real-time queue visualizations

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- **Monitor Queue Depth**: Ensure workers keep up with load
- **Check Failed Jobs**: Investigate patterns in failures
- **Redis Maintenance**: Monitor memory usage and performance
- **Log Rotation**: Manage log file sizes

### Troubleshooting

- **High Queue Depth**: Add more workers or increase concurrency
- **Many Failed Jobs**: Check user webhook URLs and network connectivity
- **Redis Issues**: Check Redis logs and connection settings
- **Worker Crashes**: Check worker logs and resource usage

2. Verify worker is running: Check delivery worker logs
3. Check job queue: Look for jobs in "waiting" state

### High Failure Rate

1. Verify user webhook URLs are accessible
2. Check network connectivity
3. Review error patterns in logs
4. Consider increasing retry attempts

### Performance Issues

1. Monitor queue depth in health endpoint
