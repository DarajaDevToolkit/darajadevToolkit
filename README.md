# Daraja Developer Toolkit 🇰🇪

> **Never lose another M-Pesa webhook again**

A reliable webhook proxy service that sits between M-Pesa and your application, solving the most common pain points in Kenyan fintech development.

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Every Kenyan developer integrating M-Pesa has experienced:

- **Lost webhooks** when dev servers go down
- **Zero visibility** into webhook delivery status
- **Manual testing** in production environments
- **No retry mechanism** when webhooks fail

## Summary 
This is a developer toolkit for M-Pesa (Daraja) that ensures webhooks are reliably delivered, retried if they fail, and logged for visibility;solving common issues like missed callbacks, sandbox failures, and silent delivery errors.

## 🚀 Our Solution

**One permanent URL + Intelligent routing + Reliability**

```
M-Pesa → [Your Permanent URL] → [Smart Validation] → [Queue] → [Environment Router] → [Your App]
```

### Key Features

- ✅ **Permanent webhook URLs** - Set once with M-Pesa, never change
- ✅ **Environment routing** - Dev/staging/prod from one URL
- ✅ **Reliable delivery** - Retries, queuing, circuit breakers
- ✅ **Full observability** - Real-time dashboard and detailed logs
- ✅ **M-Pesa compliance** - Proper validation and response handling

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Services

```
├── webhook-service/     # Receives M-Pesa webhooks (Bun + Hono)
├── delivery-worker/     # Handles webhook delivery with retries (Node.js)
├── dashboard/          # User interface (Next.js + React)
├── cli/               # Command-line interface (Python)
└── shared/            # Common types and utilities
```

### Flow

1. **M-Pesa sends webhook** → `webhook-service` (permanent URL)
2. **Validate & queue** → Ensure it's real M-Pesa, store safely
3. **Environment routing** → Determine dev/staging/prod destination
4. **Reliable delivery** → `delivery-worker` handles retries & failures
5. **Monitor & observe** → `dashboard` shows real-time status

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Bun (for webhook service)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DarajaDevToolkit/darajadevToolkit.git
cd darajadevToolkit

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development services
npm run dev
```

### Services will be running on:

- **Webhook Service**: http://localhost:3001
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3001/health

### CLI Installation (for developers):

```bash
cd cli
pip install -e .
daraja --help
```

## 📚 Usage

### Option A: CLI (Recommended for developers)

```bash
# Initialize and login
daraja init

# Configure environments
daraja config set-endpoint dev http://localhost:3000/webhook
daraja config set-endpoint prod https://yourapp.com/webhook

# Get your permanent URL for M-Pesa
daraja config get-url

# Test your setup
daraja test webhook --environment dev

# Monitor in real-time
daraja logs --tail
```

### Option B: Dashboard (Web interface)

### 1. Get Your Permanent URL

```
https://api.daraja-toolkit.com/webhook/your-user-id
```

### 2. Configure M-Pesa

Use your permanent URL in M-Pesa developer portal - never change it again!

### 3. Set Environment Routes

Configure where webhooks should be delivered:

```json
{
  "dev": "http://localhost:3000/mpesa/webhook",
  "staging": "https://staging.yourapp.com/mpesa/webhook",
  "production": "https://yourapp.com/mpesa/webhook"
}
```

### 4. Monitor & Debug

Real-time dashboard shows:

- Webhook delivery status
- Response times and success rates
- Detailed error logs
- Environment switching controls
